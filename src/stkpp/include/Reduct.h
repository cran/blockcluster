/**
 * @defgroup Reduct Dimension Reduction.
 * @brief The project Reduct propose a set of classes for computing dimension
 * Reduction (or feature extraction) of a data set.
 *
 * Feature extraction transforms the data in the high-dimensional space to a
 * space of fewer dimensions. The data transformation may be linear, as in
 * principal component analysis (PCA), but many nonlinear dimensionality
 * reduction techniques also exist.
 *
 * The main linear technique for dimensionality reduction, principal component
 * analysis, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower dimensional space
 * in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional
 * representation is maximized.
 *
 * If the data is non-linear it is possible to unfold the underlying support
 * of the data set using the local variance which try to preserve the
 * neighborhood variations of the original data set.
 *
 * An alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the
 * minimization of a cost function that measures differences between distances
 * in the input and output spaces. Important examples of such techniques include
 * classical multidimensional scaling (which is identical to PCA in somme cases),
 * Isomap (which uses geodesic distances in the data space), diffusion maps
 * (which uses diffusion distances in the data space), t-SNE (which minimizes
 * the divergence between distributions over pairs of points), and curvilinear
 * component analysis.
 *
 * @namespace Reduct This is the namespace for the reduction dimension project.
 * It will enclose all variables and constant specific to the Reduct project.
