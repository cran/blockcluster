/** @ingroup AAModels
 *  @brief A Linear AutoAssociative Model (LAAM) is a generalization of
 *  the PCA model for projecting variables on an affine plane of lower
 *  dimension.
 * 
 * A SLAAM is a (probabilistic) model of the form
 *  \f[
 *       Y = \boldsymbol{\mu}
 *                      + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \mathrm{Reg}^j(C^j) + \epsilon
 * \f]
 * in \f$ \mathbf{R}^d \f$.
 *
 *  \f$ Y \f$ is an input d dimensional random variable  and \f$ \epsilon \f$
 *  is the residual random variable.
 *  The (generalized) principal components \f$ C^{j} \f$ are real random
 *  variables estimated by a projection of the centered data on a subspace
 *  \f[
 *      C^j = <a^j,Y>.
 * \f]
 * where the \f$ a^j\f$ form an orthonormal set of vector.
 *
 *  The regression functions
 * \f$ \mathrm{Reg}^j : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^d \f$
 *  are specifics to the model.
 *
 *  A LAAM is an auto-associative model of the form
 *  \f{eqnarray*} Y_i & = & \mu
 *                       + \sum_{j=1}^{q} <a^j, Y_i - \mu> V^{j} + \epsilon_i
 *  \f}
 *
 *  In this implementation, the axis \f$ a^j \f$ are computed using any
 *  arbitrary derived class of Index.
 *
 *  The principal variables \f$ V^j \f$ are computed using least square
 *  regression. As the regression model is linear there is no necessity
 *  to use the @c setRegresor method. it will be created by this object.
